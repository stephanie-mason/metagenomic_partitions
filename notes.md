Notes about the data that Robin has sent me:

doing comparisons, confident versus fuzzy -> for sure do this one
Also show change over time
If less that 5% different on pplacer tree those are FUZZY

Division level: more simple plot because  => time series data
gene column has date
BB can be ignored cause it's all BB (bellingham bay)
BB MO D YR
Dp = deep
CM = chlorophyl max

break up the gene name so you can compare two groups, then use the count to get quantity


Lowest Classification
In this one, you8 can go down 4 levels
Also contains domain, division, class, and lowest classification
